which media query?
=================

Shows a label with the current media query in the left bottom corner.
Really helpful if you develop a responsive Web-App.
It shows the [Media Queries for Standard Devices](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)

## Usage
Just add this line in the head of your Site:
`<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="//rawgithub.com/TheBenji/which-media-query/master/media.css">`

That's it!
